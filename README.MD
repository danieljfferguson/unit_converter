# DJFF Unit Converter for Python 3

This is my first Python project!

I have built a simple unit converter for python. The unit converter works with the following:

* Temperature
  * Celcius [degC]
  * Kelvin [k]
  * Farenheit [degF]

To use the unit converter, run the converter.py script and enter the input number, its units, and the desired output unit. When defining the units, please use the nomenclature in the above list without the brackets.
